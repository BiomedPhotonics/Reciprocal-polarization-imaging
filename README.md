Reciprocal polarization imaging is based on the reciprocal polar decomposition of backscattering Mueller matrices accounting for the reciprocity of light waves in forward and backward scattering paths. Traditional decompositions such as Lu-Chipman and differential decompositions of backscattering Mueller matrices may produce erroneous medium polarization properties, whereas reciprocal polar decomposition recovers properly.

# Application
The complete set of codes for decomposing Mueller matrices measured for NBS 1963A Birefringence Resolution Target (R2L2S1B, Thorlabs) in both backward and forward geometries with our custom polarization imaging system is provided, including lu-chipman polar, differential, and reciprocal polar decomposition as presented in Reference [1]. 
# Results
The results are shown below.

Fig. 1.Polarization imaging of a birefringence resolution target in forward and backward geometries. The orientation angle, linear retardance, and depolarization from (a1, b1, c1) Lu-Chipman decomposition and (a2, b2, c2)Â  differential decomposition of the Mueller matrix measured in the forward geometry; (a3, b3, c3) Lu-Chipman decomposition, (a4, b4, c4) differential decomposition, and (a5, b5, c5) reciprocal polar decomposition of the Mueller matrix measured in the backward geometry. The linear retardance (b3, b4) obtained by Lu-Chipman and differential decompositions in the backward geometry has been multiplied by 1/2. Space bar: 0.5 mm.
